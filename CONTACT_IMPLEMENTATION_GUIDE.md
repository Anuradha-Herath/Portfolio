# Contact Form Implementation Guide

This guide covers the implementation of the contact form functionality including backend API, frontend integration, and admin interface.

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend (API Routes)
- `app/api/contact/route.ts` - Handles POST requests for contact form submissions and GET requests for admin
- `app/api/contact/[id]/route.ts` - Handles PATCH and DELETE requests for contact message management

### Database
- `supabase-contacts-migration.sql` - Database migration to create the contacts table
- `lib/types.ts` - Added ContactMessage interface
- `lib/db.ts` - Added contact-related database operations

### Frontend
- `components/(portfolio)/sections/ContactSection.tsx` - Updated to use the API instead of simulation
- `app/(admin)/admin/messages/page.tsx` - New admin interface for managing contact messages
- `components/(admin)/AdminNav.tsx` - Added Messages navigation item

## Database Setup

1. Run the migration in your Supabase dashboard:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the content from supabase-contacts-migration.sql
   ```

2. The migration creates:
   - `contacts` table with all necessary fields
   - Row Level Security policies
   - Indexes for performance
   - Triggers for updated_at timestamp

## Features Implemented

### Contact Form (Frontend)
- Form validation (required fields, email format)
- Success/error message display
- Loading states during submission
- Clean form reset after successful submission

### Admin Interface
- View all contact messages in a sortable list
- Filter messages by status (unread, read, replied)
- Mark messages as read/replied
- Delete messages
- Reply to messages via email client
- Real-time status updates

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/contact` - Submit new contact message
- `GET /api/contact` - Get all contact messages (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/contact/[id]` - Update message status
- `DELETE /api/contact/[id]` - Delete message

## Message Statuses
- **unread** - New message that hasn't been viewed
- **read** - Message has been viewed by admin
- **replied** - Admin has responded to the message

## Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization
- Email format validation
- Row Level Security policies
- Status validation for updates

## Usage

### For Users
1. Fill out the contact form on the portfolio site
2. Receive confirmation upon successful submission
3. Form validates all required fields and email format

### For Admins
1. Navigate to `/admin/messages` 
2. View all contact messages
3. Click on a message to view details
4. Use action buttons to:
   - Mark as read/replied
   - Reply via email
   - Delete message

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure you have these Supabase environment variables set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Next Steps
- Set up email notifications for new contact messages
- Add email templates for responses
